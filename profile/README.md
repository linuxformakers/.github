# Linux For Makers (LFM)
This isn’t your average Linux.

**Linux For Makers (LFM)** is built for people who **actually want control**. Based on **Void Linux**, stripped of bloat, and honed with **Arch-level minimalism and performance**, LFM gives a system you can **own, tweak, and push to the limit**.

* **No fluff. No hand-holding.** You build it, you run it, you master it.
* **100% kernel compile benchmarks.** Pure power, pure speed.
* **XBPS package manager**. Works with any desktop environment.
* **Fully open-source**. Look under the hood, modify, or fork it’s yours.

This is a distro for **makers, hackers, builders, and perfectionists**. If you like pre-packaged crap, go look elsewhere.

Created and maintained by **Noor**, for people who want their Linux the way it should be: **theirs**.
