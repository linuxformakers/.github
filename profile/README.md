# Linux For Makers (LFM)
This isn’t your average Linux.

**Linux For Makers (LFM)** is built for people who **actually want control**. Based on **Void Linux**, stripped of bloat, and honed with **Arch-level minimalism and performance**, LFM gives a system you can **own, tweak, and push to the limit**.

* **No fluff. No hand-holding.** You build it, you run it, you master it.
* **100% kernel compile benchmarks.** Pure power, pure speed.
* **XBPS package manager**. Works with any desktop environment.
* **Fully open-source**. Look under the hood, modify, or fork it’s yours.

This is a distro for **makers, hackers, builders, and perfectionists**. If you like pre-packaged crap, go look elsewhere.

## Why XBPS is My Choice for LFM

I get how some people might wonder why I stuck with XBPS, especially since it feels outdated and doesn’t get constant updates. The truth is, I chose it because it’s fast, predictable, and rock solid. When you compile the kernel or build your own tools, you know it’s going to work every time. It’s not about having thousands of packages. It’s about control, reliability, and zero bloat.

Converting DEB packages is easy in XBPS, so adding extra software is a win for everyone. And if you want even more options, Flathub and Flatpak are fully supported. Honestly, you don’t even feel limited once you get used to it.

I want LFM to be more than just a system its a space for makers and hackers to learn, tinker, and share. If you want to contribute, share ideas, or just hang out, join the Discord. It’s the perfect place for the community to grow, and every contribution is a win for everyone.

XBPS gives LFM that precision and predictability that other package managers can’t.
